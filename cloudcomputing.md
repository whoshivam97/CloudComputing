Let's start by defining cloud computing cloud computing is the on demand availability of computer system
resources for example servers storage backup network and security within an environment under single
point of management that shall be available to serve multiple users.
Users can be working together in a single entity or location performing the same job.

So we have two main cloud architectures, in the first architecture cloud resources can be designed and
implemented in a single enterprise data center to provide services to this enterprise employees and
customers which we call it enterprise private cloud also known as private cloud.

In other setup or architecture, these cloud resources can be owned by a provider that is making its services available from data centers
at different locations around the globe.
We call this architecture public cloud, the company that is offering such services in this context is
defined as cloud service providers.
