We will take it from two dimensions or perspectives.
Business Aspect:

The first perspective is the business perspective and for sure when it comes to business reachability
is the key.
Any user can reach the services provided by the cloud,Anytime from any location, either his work office, his working site or his home.

With the cloud also we can provide services to all business units separately.However it is sharing infrastructure resources hence saving costs.

in discussion about costs, Cloud has metering capabilities that enables financial reporting for cross charging chargeback or showback reports across different units or departments.

And from financial model point of view,The cloud enables pay as you go model with which we no longer need long or legacy purchasing cycles withpre-booked budgets,The cloud users pay bills which represent costs of the services they have used during the billing cycle.

Having this in mind cloud offers the agility of supply chain that is considered a major enabler for
the business flexibility required in most modern businesses.

No more worries of expanding the current infrastructure to support new modules or new business lines websites that is planned to be launched soon.

The whole setup can be expanded with couple of clicks. Cloud also assures end to end by design business continuity in case of disaster.

Nothing will be required more than activating the services from another zone or another location.
And this is what we will see and the technical benefits

All these feature, If designed properly will result in cost reductions which is a major aspect of any transformation in any business.
